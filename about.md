## The Man Behind the Moose

## The Past

The year was 1992..."Baby Got Back" is playing on the local radio station for the hundreth time, and CD's have just gotten the better of cassette tapes (WHAT a year!).  Zoom into a small town in Colorado: this is where our story begins.

Being an army brat meant having to pack up and move a LOT as a kid.  This was of course stressful at times, but I also gained an appreciation for travel and embracing change as it comes.  By the time I was hitting double digits I had already lived in multiple countries and states across the US.  It's not surprising that this trend would carry into my adult hood.

I started dancing when I was 14 years old, and boy was I BAD!  No rhythm, two left feet, and minimal confidence.  Still, I had an innate feeling that this was my trajectory for the foreseeable future.  With lots of hard work, long nights learning from youtube videos, and a little bit of luck I was able get accepted into a collegiate dance program.  After graduating I had the opportunity to perform around the world.  Dream come true right?  Getting paid to do what I love AND travel??  Sometimes I look back and it doesn't even seem real.  Just goes to show that with enough nerve and dedication just about anything is possible.

After dancing for some years I unfortunately suffered an injury that would end my professional career.  This was upsetting, but I was (and still am) so appreciative for that experience. Dance taught me so much about life.  Pursuing something your passionate about, working hard, dealing with rejection, and gaining some much needed confidence in myself.  As I looked forward from this point, I realized that whatever I was going to do next needed to come with the same feelings of passion and dedication that I felt for dance.  Who knew, of all things, this would end up being cybersecurity?

Growing up during a tech revolution was fascinating (don't quote me on this, but my generation may have been some of the last kids to learn cursive and typing at the same time in elementary school!).  I was enamored with computers and video games and by a young age I was already tinkering, breaking, rebuilding, and learning everything I could.  By high school I had already custom built my own gaming PC, and unknown to me at the time, I was doing some coding with HTML (thanks Myspace).  My dad also worked in technology, and I have fond memories of him teaching me back in the day.  I can still remember when he explained to me what a modem was for the first time!

With my dance career at an end I was on the precipice of change.  It didn't take long to figure out what my next steps were, and taking my dads advice, I started getting some certifications to help me break into the industry.  It's been a journey, and needless to say the pandemic threw a couple wrenches in my gears.  But I've kept at it because I knew this is what I want to do.  

## The Present

I can now proudly say that I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance from WGU and more certifications than you can shake a stick at.  I'm also lucky enough to boast about my amazing relationship, dog, friends, and family.  I've let my passions guide me to this point and am confident that I'm exactly where I'm suppsed to be.  

I currently have a lot of hobbies...probably too many!  My partner and I have an impressive resume of home projects under our belt.  I love gardening and learning about plants.  I still play tons of video games, and I try to read when I get the chance.  On top of that, I love to travel, listen to music, and of course, enjoying a few moments of peace watching "The Price is Right" reruns.

## The Future

What's my 5 year plan?  Great question!  I'm long enough in the tooth to know that things don't always go according to plan, so I like to refer to this as my "5 year rough draft."  

So in 5 years...tons of money, big house, fancy car, and a farm chalk full of cattle dogs!  Okay, okay...maybe too unrealistic?  How about this:  In 5 years my goal is too expand my career.  To me this means taking the time to explore all the diferent areas of cybersecurity, figuring out where I can offer the most value, and continuing of my own path of personal growth and development.
