      I had the honor of supporting and leading AJ through his Bachelorâ€™s in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (BSCSIA) degree program at Western Governors University. AJ was one of my top students moving through the core of his program at an extremely accelerated pace, speaking to his work ethic, diligence, study habits, knowledge, and skill. He was an absolute delight to talk with each week on our calls, showing himself to be a consummate professional and a warm, kind human being. AJ earned 15 top industry certifications while at WGU including CYSA+, PENTEST+, Network+, Security+, A+, ITIL, and more equipping him for an info sec role. I am confident he will absolutely excel - and that any organization will fortunate to have AJ in their arsenal.
