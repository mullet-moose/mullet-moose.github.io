### Ethical Guidelines Relating to ISSA

The ISSA Code of Ethics Guideline: “Refrain from any activities which might constitute a conflict of interest or otherwise damage the reputation of or is detrimental to employers, the information security profession, or the Association (ISSA Code of Ethics, n.d.).

Carl Jaspers ignored the nondisclosure agreements with Orange Leaf Software LLC and Union City Electronic Ventures and subsequently released their trade secrets to competitors.  This is a conflict of interest that damaged the reputation of TechFite, caused harm to Orange Leaf and Union City, and tarnished the information security profession.  

Carl Jaspers could have used this guideline to engage in more ethical and professional behavior by refraining from these activates which established a conflict of interest.  

### Ethical Guidelines Relating to GIAC

The GIAC Code of Ethics Guideline: “I will not engage in or be a party to unethical or unlawful acts that negatively affect the community, my professional reputation, or the information security discipline” (GIAC Code of Ethics, n.d.)

Megan Rogers and Jack Hudson violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) when the took direction from Sarah Miller in scanning other companies networks to gather intelligence without their consent or authorization. 
 
Rogers and Hudson could have used this guideline to engage in more ethical behavior by not following the direction from Miller and refraining from this illegal activity.  Furthermore, this guideline may have persuaded them to report Miller’s illegal behavior. 

### Unethical Practices

Carl Jaspers:
  - Engaged in conflicts of interest when he shared trade secrets to competitors.
  - Used dummy accounts to illegally examine documents from other departments in TechFite.
  - Misrepresented his abilities and work by using illegitimate companies to inflate sales numbers for his division.

Nadia Johnson:
  - Failed to engage in proper auditing best practices and standards that allowed unlawful actions to occur.
  - Failed to report unlawful and unethical behaviors that others were engaged in that she was most likely aware of.
  - Maintained an unprofessional relationship with Carl Jaspers which she used to wrongfully elevate her status in TechFite.

Sarah Miller:
  - Engaged in unlawful behavior by scanning other companies networks to gather information.
  - Encouraged other employees (Megan Rogers and Jack Hudson) to engage in similarly unlawful behaviors.
  
### Contributing Factors

There is no policy in place at TechFite that encourages the safeguarding of sensitive information and discourages conflicts of interest between clients (potential, current, or past).  This lack of policy allowed Carl Jaspers to give trade secrets from Orange Leaf and Union City to competitors.

Least privilege principles were not enforced.  Each workstation had full administrative rights, which allowed employees to manipulate information for their own benefit.  Jaspers was able to use dummy accounts to gather intelligence and use illegitimate clients to inflate sales numbers.

Separation of duties principles were not enforced.  Each division had full access and visibility into each other division.  This contributed to unethical conflicts of interest and made it easier for employees like Sarah Miller, Carl Jasper, Nadia Johnson, Megan Rogers, and Jack Hudson to engage in and hide their unethical and unlawful behaviors.

There are no policies relating to professional relationships between co-workers.  Nadia Johnson and Carl Jaspers used their relationship to hide unethical behaviors and elevate themselves within the company.

### Information Security Policies

#### Account Creation/Termination Policy

A clear Account Creation and Termination Policy was not in place at TechFite.  While most employee accounts were made in normal fashion, it’s clear that proper vetting of new accounts and periodic review of current accounts were not being enforced or encouraged.  Proper vetting of any new employee accounts would have prevented the creation of the dummy accounts at the request of Carl Jaspers, which he used to engage in unethical behaviors like gathering intelligence from various companies through “dumpster diving” and “trash surveillance.”  This policy also would have deterred the negligent act of management in creating these dummy accounts, as they would have needed to go through a proper vetting process and would have realized that the employees assigned to these accounts were no longer current.  Additionally, if a periodic review of current accounts had taken place, management at TechFite would have been made aware of these dummy accounts and their actions, which were a threat to the intellectual property of the other companies they were surveilling. 

#### Chinese Wall Policy

A proper Chinese Wall Policy was not enacted or enforced at TechFite.  Such a policy would enforce the segregation of clients’ information and employees at TechFite who handled that information to prevent conflicts of interest.  This policy would protect the intellectual property of TechFite’s potential, current, and past clients by preventing their proprietary information from getting into the hands of competitors.  Carl Jaspers was able to provide the intellectual property of Orange Leaf Software LLC and Union City Electronic Ventures to his other clients, even in violation of the nondisclosure agreements he had executed with them. Management at TechFite was negligent in their lack of enactment of a Chinese Wall Policy which could have prevented or deterred Jaspers from sharing intellectual property between clients.

### Security Awareness, Training, and Education

The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) will oversee and manage the TechFite SATE Program and ensure the program meets industry standards, updates the program accordingly, and enforces any repercussions for non-compliance.

All employees of TechFite will be required to attend training.  A general training will be required that covers information applicable to all employees (Ethics, Best Practices, Code of Conduct, Relationships in the Workplace, and Security Awareness), while specialized training will be provided that pertains to specific departments and positions.  

Department Heads will be required to deliver training courses for their respective employees.  This allows management to define and set good examples while also building repour with their teams.  

The repercussions for non-compliance will vary depending on the severity of the offense in question and intent or lack thereof.  Clear guidelines will be provided to employees for intolerable violations that will result in immediate termination from TechFite.  The CISO will have discretion in these repercussions, however, unique or complicated situations may require the creation of a committee including other senior management for proper resolution and action.  

### SATE Communication

A multi-faceted approach will be used to communicate the implantation of TechFite’s SATE Program:
  - A company wide e-blast will be used to inform all employees of the SATE program and it’s requirements.
  - An updated Code of Conduct and Ethics contract will be created and required to be reviewed and signed by all current employees and any new employees thereafter.
  - Department Heads will be responsible for leading department meetings that will overview training schedules and required attendance.  
  - Any company meetings or trainings will be required to include food, beverages, and an interactive communication format (game show, challenges, rewards, etc.) to foster company culture and increase conscious engagement with the program.  
  - Department Heads will also be encouraged to be innovative in their approaches on training (with prior approval by the CISO) to further increase engagement and foster company culture.
TechFite will sponsor a company wide event (Baseball Game, Top Golf, Bowling Night, etc.) to incentivize employees to complete training.  100% employee attendance and completion of trainings are needed for the event to take place.  

### Justification

Sarah Miller engaged in undesirable and illegal behavior when she exploited other companies’ networks to gain information.  The new and improved SATE Program at TechFite will clearly state that there is a no-tolerance policy for engaging in illegal behaviors.  This policy would have acted as a deterrent for Miller, as she would have clearly defined consequences for her actions (immediate termination).  Additionally, required trainings on Acceptable Use and Ethics would have educated Miller on why exactly her actions were wrong and undesirable (if, perhaps, she was unaware her actions were illegal and acted in negligence).  

Carl Jaspers and Nadia Johnson had an inappropriate relationship at TechFite.  Johnson conducted oversight on Jaspers, which both parties used to their advantage.  Johnson would engage in overly lax internal reviews of the Business Intelligence Unit, allowing Jaspers to get away with nefarious behaviors.  As a quid pro quo, Jaspers would give sterling reviews of Johnson to her boss, which resulted in frequent and ample raises for Johnson.   The new and improved SATE Program at TechFite will educate employees about acceptable workplace relationships and how inappropriate relationships create conflicts of interest.  Additionally, employees would be educated on the ramifications for inappropriate relationships, and guidelines for addressing these relationships when they present themselves.  Had Jaspers and Johnson been educated on proper workplace relationships they may have been deterred from using them for their own self benefit at the determent of the company.  

### Ethical Issues and Mitigation

TechFite is currently faced with numerous ethical challenges.  Carl Jaspers is engaging in acts that constitute conflicts of interest, including his sharing of proprietary information between clients, and his inappropriate relationship with Nadia Johnson that he used to hide his actions.  Nadia Johnson was also unethical in using her relationship with Jaspers to elevate her status in the company and gain undeserved raises.  Sarah Miller was unethical in her behaviors regarding exploiting other companies networks to gain information, and influencing other employees to follow along.  Megan Rogers and Jack Hudson were also unethical in following Millers actions and engaging in similar fashion.  

The enactment of the proposed SATE Program, implementing and enforcing updated company Policies and Procedures, and clearly defining a Code of Conduct and Ethics for employees to follow will mitigate these issues.  Employees will be deterred from engaging in unethical behaviors, and will be held accountable for any violations.  Additionally, employees will be educated on best practices, legal issues and ramifications, and upholding company ethics and values so they may not act in negligence.
