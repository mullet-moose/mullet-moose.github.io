### CFAA and ECPA

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) “criminalizes the act of causing certain
types of damage to a protected computer without authorization or by exceeding authorized
access” (Grama, 2022, p. 498). According to the CFAA, a computer is considered protected
if it is used in interstate commerce. In this case study, TechFite’s computers are engaged in
business transactions conducted on the internet (interstate commerce), therefore classifying
them as protected. An instance that exemplifies unauthorized access would be the creation
and usage of dummy accounts by the Business Intelligence Unit and Carl Jaspers to gain
access to groups and units outside of the division to view financial and executive documents
without proper authorization.

The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) “sets out provisions for access, use,
disclosure, and interception of electronic communications” (Grama, 2022, p. 78). Sarah
Millers use of Metasploit to gain access to other companies’ networks and communications
without their consent or authorization would be a violation of the ECPA.

### Application of Laws and Regulations

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX):

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted to “protect shareholders and investors from
financial fraud” (Grama, 2022, p. 283). The negligence in the disregard of the principle of least
privilege and separation of duties within the Business Intelligence Unit allowed the creation of
three illegitimate companies found by Jackson in his investigation: Bebop Software, FGH
Research Group, and Dazzling Comet Software. Yu Lee, who had a previous relationship with
Jaspers at Stanford University, was the registered agent for all three companies. Additionally, all
three of these companies use Freeworkers’ Pennsylvania Bank and are all incorporated in
Nevada. Jackson asserts that these companies were not actual clients but were used to bloat the
sales numbers for the Applications Division, headed by Jaspers. These inflations could be used
to persuade investors into buying stock that is presumed to be more valuable. If the principle of
least privilege and separation of duties had been enacted and enforced, this likely would never
have happened, as these illegitimate accounts would have never been created.

Electronic Communications and Privacy Act (ECPA):

Sarah Miller was discovered to have utilized the Metasploit tool to gain unauthorized
access to communications from other companies without their consent. Her actions are a
violation of the ECPA. The negligence in proper and consistent auditing procedures let this act
go unnoticed.

Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA):

The Business Intelligence Unit’s creation and use of dummy accounts allowed it gain
unauthorized access to financial and executive documents which is a violation of the CFAA.
Each dummy account was assigned to an employee that had not worked at TechFite for some
time. Had proper and consistent user account auditing been taking place, these dummy accounts
would have been flagged and noticed much sooner, preventing their misuse by Jaspers and
others.

### Duty of Care

Duty of due care is defined as “a person’s obligation to avoid acts or omissions that can
harm others” (Grama, 2022, p. 508). A specific instance in which someone did not avoid an act
that caused another harm was in Jaspers’ disclosing of Orange Leaf Software LLC’s technical
information about its products to a competitor (also a client of Jaspers). This is especially
disturbing as a non-disclosure agreement had been executed by Jaspers himself. This caused
economic damage to Orange Leaf, as the competitor was able to launch products like their own,
siphoning some of their potential sales.

Sarah Millers use of Metasploit would be another instance where duty of due care was
absent. Using Metasploit, she was able to access other Internet-based companies’ networks and
communications. This caused harm to the companies that were hacked, as sensitive information
was most likely acquired which could be used to cause economic or reputational damage.

### SOX Application

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) aims to “protect shareholders and investors from
financial fraud” by increasing “corporate disclosure requirements” (Grama, 2022, p. 283).
During his investigation, John Jackson performed an audit on the client list database for the
Applications Division. He discovered three illegitimate companies associated with Carl Jaspers:
Bebop Software, FGH Research Group, and Dazzling Comet Software. All three companies
were incorporated in Nevada, registered with the same agent (Yu Lee, who had a prior
relationship with Jaspers), and used the same bank (Freeworkers’ Pennsylvania Bank).
Additionally, TechFite did not have an account with Freeworkers’ Pennsylvania Bank, which
alludes to the bank using an off-the-books payment method. It is likely that these illegitimate
companies were used to inflate sales numbers for the Applications Division which could
persuade investors by exaggerating the appeal of TechFite.

IT Security Analyst Nadia Johnson never performed an audit on the client list database
for the Applications Division. Her audits into the Business Intelligence Unit were also lacking,
as they did not provide sufficient details about auditing user’s accounts, privilege escalations,
internal surveillance of network traffic, and the enforcement of data loss prevention. The lack of
required auditing practices would also be considered a violation of SOX.

### Instances of Criminal Activity

Instance #1

Carl Jaspers, head of the Applications Division, allegedly engaged in criminal activity
when he violated the nondisclosure agreements that were executed in the pre-consulting process
with both Orange Leaf Software LLC and Union City Electronic Ventures. The information that
was provided (considered to be trade secrets under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act) was supplied
to competitors that were also clients of Jasper’s. The competitors later launched products like
Orange Leaf’s and Union City’s, causing them economic damage by siphoning potential sales.
Both Orange Leaf and Union City would be considered the victims of the alleged crime.

Instance #2

Metasploit was used by numerous Business Intelligence Unit analyst (Miller, Rogers, and
Hudson) to gain access to other companies’ networks and communications without said
companies consent or authorization. This is a violation of the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act (ECPA). The victims of this alleged crime would be the Internet-based companies
whose networks and communications were wrongfully accessed.

### Failure of Existing Policies

Instance #1

Carl Jaspers was able to provide proprietary information and trade secrets about Orange
Leaf Software LLC’s and Union City Electronic Venture’s products to competitors that were
also his clients. The Chinese Wall policy was not part of any general policy at TechFite.
Employing such a policy would have acknowledged conflicts of interest and kept the client’s
proprietary information and trade secrets segregated from each other. Had a Chinese Wall policy
been implanted, Carl Jaspers would not have been able to provide trade secrets to competitors
which caused economic damage to Orange Leaf and Union City. The proprietary information
provided in the nondisclosure agreements of Orange Leaf and Union City would be considered
trade secrets and protected from misappropriation under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA).

Instance #2

Sarah Miller, Megan Rogers, and Jack Hudson were analysts of the Business Intelligence
Unit at TechFite. They performed a criminal act when they used Metasploit to gain access to
other Internet-based companies’ networks and communication without proper consent or
authorization. This is in direct violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA).
Had an Acceptable Use Policy been enacted and enforced, these actions could have been
deterred. Additionally, had a proper Auditing Policy been enacted and enforced, these actions
could have been detected before Miller, Rogers, and Hudson were able to cause economic
damage to the hacked companies and reputational damage to TechFite itself.

### Identifying Negligent Actors and Victims

Instance #1

The Business Intelligence Unit was negligent when it failed to enact and enforce a proper
Chinese Wall policy. This carelessness allowed Carl Jaspers to share trade secrets from potential
clients Orange Leaf Software LLC and Union City Electronic Ventures with competitors (current
clients of Jasper’s). This resulted in economic damage to Orange Leaf and Union City, as
competitors were able to use their trade secrets to release similar products. Both Orange Leaf
and Union City were the victims of this negligence. Had a proper Chinese Wall policy been
enacted and enforced, conflicts of interest would be acknowledged, and trade secrets would be
kept segregated between clients and those that represent them within TechFite.

Instance #2

The Business Intelligence Unit was also negligent when it failed to enact and enforce a
proper Acceptable Use Policy. This carelessness allowed Miller, Rogers, and Hudson to use
Metasploit to gain access to other Internet-based companies’ networks and communications.
The unauthorized access and use of these communications could cause harm to the hackedcompanies, making them the victims of the negligent act. Had a proper Acceptable Use Policy
been enacted and enforced, these actions could have been deterred.

### Failure to Prevent Negligent Practices

Instance #1

The Business Intelligence unit was negligent when it failed to address conflicts of
interests between clients/potential clients and those handling their information. Carl Jaspers was
easily able to violate the NDA’s put in place to protect Orange Leaf Software LLC and Union
City Electronic Ventures by providing their trade secrets to competitors. Had a Chinese Wall
policy been enacted and enforced, the trade secrets of Orange Leaf and Union City and those
handling them (Carl Jaspers) would have been segregated and kept secure from competitors.
Conflicts of interest would not be created, because TechFite representatives would be segregated
from handling accounts of competitors.

Instance #2

The Business Intelligence Unit was also negligent in its lack of a proper Acceptable Use
Policy. Sarah Millers use of Metasploit to gain access to other Internet-based companies’
networks and communications would not be allowed under such policy. Had a proper
Acceptable Use Policy been enacted and enforced, Miller may have been deterred from
exploiting the other Internet-based companies’ networks and communications and potentially
causing them harm.

### Summary of Legal Compliance

TechFite is not considered legally compliant under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA),
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(SOX). The Business Intelligence Unit’s creation and use of dummy accounts to gain
unauthorized access to other departments’ financial and executive documents is in direct
violation of the CFAA. The use of Metasploit by Sarah Miller to gain access to other Internet-
based companies’ networks and communications is in direct violation of the ECPA. The use of
three illegitimate organizations by Carl Jaspers to inflate sales numbers and persuade potential
investors is in direct violation of SOX.
